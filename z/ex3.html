  <h2>Mathematical formulas</h2>

  <h3>Linear Equations</h3>

  <p>A linear equation is any equation that can be written in the form</p>
  <div class="formula"><span class="form">ax + b = 0</span></div>
  <p>where <span class="eee">a</span> and <span class="eee">b</span> are real numbers and <span class="eee">x</span> is
    a variable. This form is sometimes called the standard form of a linear equation. Note that most linear equations
    will not start off in this form. Also, the variable may or may not be an <span class="eee">x</span> so
    don<sup>’</sup>t get too locked into
    always seeing an <span class="eee">x</span> there.</p>

  <p>
  <h3>Quadratic Equation</h3>

  The standard form of a quadratic equation looks like this:

  <div class="formula"><span class="form">ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c = 0</span></div>

    where <span class="eee">a</span>, <span class="eee">b</span>, <span class="eee">c</span> are known values and x is
    the
    variable or unknown (we don't know it yet). Also, <span class="eee">a</span> can't be 0.
    </p>

    <p>
    <h3>The area of a circle (A)</h3>

    <span class="eee">π</span> (Pi) times the radius (<span class="eee">r</span>) squared:

    <div class="formula"><span class="form">A = π ˣ r<sup>2</span></sup></div>

      or, when you know the diameter (<span class="eee">D</span>):
      <div class="formula"><span class="form">A = π / 4) ˣ D<sup>2</sup></span></div>

        or, when you know the circumference (<span class="eee">C</span>):
        <div class="formula"><span class="form">A = C<sup>2</sup> / 4 ˣ π</span></div>
          </p>

          <p>
          <h3>Intersection</h3>

          The intersection of two sets <span class="eee">A</span> and <span class="eee">B</span>, denoted by A Ո B, is
          the set
          of all objects that are members of both the sets A and B. In symbols,

          <div class="formula"><span class="form">A Ո B = { x : x ∈ A and x ∈ B }</span></div>

            That is, <span class="eee">x</span> is an element of the intersection A Ո B if and only if <span
              class="eee">x</span>
            is both an element of <span class="eee">A</span> and an element of <span class="eee">B</span>.
